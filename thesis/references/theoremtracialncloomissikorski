Suppose $S$ is a $\sigma$-complete Boolean inverse monoid satisfying (SC), endowed with an invariant mean $\mu$ which is countably additive (i.e., a probability on $E(S)$). Then there exists a $\ra$-discrete probability measure-preserving groupoid $(\mathcal{G},\mu')$ and an isomorphism from $S$ to $\MEAS(\mathcal{G},\mu')$ which is isometric with respect to the uniform metrics.
