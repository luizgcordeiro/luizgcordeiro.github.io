		Let $R$ be an indecomposable ring, $\theta$ and $\gamma$ be ample, topologically free partial actions of inverse semigroups $S$ and $T$ on $X$ and $Y$, respectively, and suppose that the groupoids of germs $S\ltimes_\theta X$ and $T\ltimes_\gamma Y$ are Hausdorff. Then the following are equivalent:
		<div class='arpar'>
			<li>
				The partial actions $\theta$ and $\gamma$ are continuously orbit equivalent.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				The groupoids of germs $S\ltimes_\theta X$ and $T\ltimes_\gamma Y$ are topologically isomorphic
			</li>
			
			<li>
				The inverse semigroups $\KB(S\ltimes_\theta X)$ and $\KB(T\ltimes_\gamma Y)$ are isomorphic.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				The inverse semigroups $[[S\ltimes_\theta X]]$ and $[[T\ltimes_\gamma Y]]$ are isomorphic/
			</li>
			
			<li>
				There exists a diagonal-preserving algebra (or ring) isomorphism between the Steinberg algebras $A_R(S\ltimes_\theta X)$ and $A_R(T\ltimes_\gamma Y)$.
			</li>
			
			<li>
				There exists a diagonal-preserving algebra (or ring) isomorphism between the crossed products $A_R(X)\rtimes S$ and $A_R(Y)\rtimes T$ (with respect to the algebraic partial actions induced by $\theta$ and $\gamma$).
