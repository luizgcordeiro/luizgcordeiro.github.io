	Suppose that $G$ and $H$ are Hausdorff topological groups, and $X$ and $Y$ are compact Hausdorff spaces for which $(X,\overline{1_G},C(X,G))$ and $(Y,\overline{1_H},C(Y,H))$ are regular.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Let $T:C(X,G)\to C(Y,H)$ be a non-vanishing group isomorphism (Definition <span class='ref' data-tag='definitionnonvanishingbijection'></span>). Then there exist a homeomorphism $\phi:Y\to X$ and a map $w:Y\to\operatorname{AbsIso}(H,G)$ such that $Tf(y)=w(y)(f(\phi(y))$ for all $y\in Y$ and $f\in C(X,G)$.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If $T$ is continuous on the constant functions then each $w(y)$ is continuous and $T$ is continuous on $C(X,G)$. If both $T$ and $T^{-1}$ are continuous on the constant functions then $w(y)\in\operatorname{TopIso}(H,G)$ and $T$ is a homeomorphism for the topologies of pointwise convergence.
