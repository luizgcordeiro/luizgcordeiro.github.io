	Let $X$ and $Y$ be locally compact Hausdorff and for $Z\in\left\{X,Y\right\}$, $H_Z$ a Hausdorff space and $\theta_Z\in C(Z,H_Z)$ be given such that $(Z,\theta_Z,C_c(Z,\theta_Z))$ is regular.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	Suppose that $T:C_c(X,\theta_X)\to C_c(Y,\theta_Y)$ is a $\perpp$-isomorphism, that $\phi:Y\to X$ is the $T$-homeomorphism $\phi$, and that that $T$ is $\phi$-basic. Let $\chi:Y\times H_X\to H_Y$ be the corresponding $(\phi,T)$-transform. Consider the following statements:
	<ol class='arpar'>
		<li>
			$\chi$ is continuous.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			Each section $\chi(y,\cdot)$ is a continuous.
		</li>
		
		<li>
			$T$ is continuous with respect to the topologies of pointwise convergence.
		</li>
	</ol>
	Then the implications (1)$\Longrightarrow$(2)$\iff$(3) always hold.
	</p>
	
	<p>
	If $X$, $Y$ and $H_X$ are first countable, $H_X$ is locally path-connected and $\theta_X$ is constant, then $(2)\Longrightarrow (1)$ as well, so all three statements are equivalent.
