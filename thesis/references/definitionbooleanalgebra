A <em>generalized Boolean algebra</em> is a lattice with zero which is distributive (as a semigroup under meets) and which admits relative complements of any two (comparable) elements. A <em>unital Boolean algebra</em> is a generalized Boolean algebra admitting a maximum (in particular, it is a monoid).
