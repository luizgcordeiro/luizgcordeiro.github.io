abstract = {In this work we give a presentation of the prefix expansion $\operatorname{\bf{Pr}}(G)$ of an inverse semigroup $G$ as recently introduced by Lawson, Margolis and Steinberg which is similar to the universal inverse semigroup defined by the second named author in case $G$ is a group. The inverse semigroup $\operatorname{\bf{Pr}}(G)$ classifies the partial actions of $G$ on spaces. We extend this result and prove that Fell bundles over $G$ correspond bijectively to saturated Fell bundles over $\operatorname{\bf{Pr}}(G)$. In particular, this shows that twisted partial actions of $G$ (on $C^*$-algebras) correspond to twisted (global) actions of $\operatorname{\bf{Pr}}(G)$. Furthermore, we show that this correspondence preserves $C^*$-algebras crossed products.},

We show that if $G$ and $H$ are equivalent in the sense of Muhly--Renault--Williams, then the associated Steinberg algebras are Morita equivalent. We deduce that collapsing a ``collapsible subgraph'' of a directed graph in the sense of Crisp and Gow does not change the Morita-equivalence class of the associated Leavitt path $R$-algebra, and therefore a number of graphical constructions which yield Morita equivalent $C^*$-algebras also yield Morita equivalent Leavitt path algebras.},

We then apply this realization to characterize diagonal preserving isomorphisms of partial skew group rings, over commutative algebras, in terms of continuous orbit equivalence of the associated partial actions. Finally, we show that any Steinberg algebra, associated to a Hausdorff ample groupoid, can be seen as a partial skew inverse semigroup ring.},

In difference from this last note, we consider a ring of continuous functions defined on a rertain topological space as a purely algebraical formation, without introducing in it any topological relations. It turns out that in the case of bicompact spaces considered by M. Stone, as well as in considerably more general cases, the algebraical structure of the ring of continuous functions already defines the topological space up to a homeomorphism.},

abstract = {A topological group $G$ is called extremely amenable if every continuous action of $G$ on a compact space has a fixed point. This concept is linked with geometry of high dimensions (concentration of measure). We show that a von Neumann algebra is approximately finite-dimensional if and only if its unitary group with the strong topology is the product of an extremely amenable group with a compact group, which strengthens a result by de la Harpe. As a consequence, a $C^*$-algebra $A$ is nuclear if and only if the unitary group $U(A)$ with the relative weak topology is strongly amenable in the sense of Glasner. We prove that the group of automorphisms of a Lebesgue space with a non-atomic measure is extremely amenable with the weak topology and establish a similar result for groups of non-singular transformations. As a consequence, we prove extreme amenability of the groups of isometries of $L^p(0,1)$, $1\leq p<\infty$, extending a classical result of Gromov and Milman ($p=2$). We show that a measure class preserving equivalence relation $\mathcal{R}$ on a standard Borel space is amenable if and only if the full group $[{\mathcal R}]$, equipped with the uniform topology, is extremely amenable. Finally, we give natural examples of concentration to a nontrivial space in the sense of Gromov occuring in the automorphism groups of injective factors of type III.},

abstract = {We describe a special class of representations of an inverse semigroup $S$ on Hilbert's space which we term tight. These representations are supported on a subset of the spectrum of the idempotent semilattice of $S$, called the tight spectrum, which is in turn shown to be precisely the closure of the space of ultra-filters, once filters are identified with semicharacters in a natural way. These representations are more-over shown to correspond to representations of the $C^*$-algebra of the groupoid of germs for the action of $S$ on its tight spectrum. We then treat the case of certain inverse semigroups constructed from semigroupoids, generalizing and inspired by inverse semigroups constructed from ordinary and higher rank graphs. The tight representations of this inverse semigroup are in one-to-one correspondence with representations of the semigroupoid, and consequently the semigroupoid algebra is given a groupoid model. The groupoid which arises from this construction is shown to be the same as the boundary path groupoid of Farthing, Muhly and Yeend, at least in the singly aligned, sourceless case.},

For an arbitrary graph $E$ and a subset $R$ of the set of regular vertices of $E$ we show that the relative graph $C^*$-algebra $C^*(E,R)$ is isomorphic to a partial crossed product for an action of the free group generated by the edge set on the relative boundary path space. Given a time evolution on $C^*(E,R)$ induced by a function on the edge set, we characterize the $\text{KMS}_\beta$ states and ground states using an abstract result of Exel and Laca. Guided by their work on KMS states for Toeplitz–Cuntz–Krieger type algebras associated to infinite matrices, we obtain complete descriptions of the convex sets of KMS states of finite type and of KMS states of infinite type whose associated measures are supported on recurrent infinite paths. This allows us to give a complete concrete description of the convex set of all KMS states for a big class of graphs which includes all graphs with finitely many vertices.},

They can be characterized as subgroups of metric ultraproducts of families of, respectively, unitary groups U(n) and symmetric groups S n , n ∈ ℕ. Hyperlinear groups come from theory of operator algebras (Connes' Embedding Problem), while sofic groups, introduced by Gromov, are motivated by a problem of symbolic dynamics (Gottschalk's Surjunctivity Conjecture). Open questions are numerous, in particular it is still unknown if every group is hyperlinear and/or sofic.},

abstract = {This article generalizes our previous results [Le Ma{\^{i}}tre. The number of topological generators for full groups of ergodic equivalence relations. Invent. Math. 198 (2014), 261–268] to the non-ergodic case by giving a formula relating the topological rank of the full group of an aperiodic probability-measure-preserving (pmp) equivalence relation to the cost of its ergodic components. Furthermore, we obtain examples of full groups that have a dense free subgroup whose rank is equal to the topological rank of the full group, using a Baire category argument. We then study the automatic continuity property for full groups of aperiodic equivalence relations, and find a connected metric for which they have the automatic continuity property. This allows us to provide an algebraic characterization of aperiodicity for pmp equivalence relations, namely the non-existence of homomorphisms from their full groups into totally disconnected separable groups. A simple proof of the extreme amenability of full groups of hyperfinite pmp equivalence relations is also given, generalizing a result of Giordano and Pestov to the non-ergodic case [Giordano and Pestov. Some extremely amenable groups related to operator algebras and ergodic theory. J. Inst. Math. Jussieu 6 (2) (2007), 279–315, Theorem 5.7].},

abstract = {We introduce the notion of orbit equivalence of directed graphs, following Matsumoto's notion of continuous orbit equivalence for topological Markov shifts. We show that two graphs in which every cycle has an exit are orbit equivalent if and only if there is a diagonal-preserving isomorphism between their $C^*$-algebras. We show that it is necessary to assume that every cycle has an exit for the forward implication, but that the reverse implication holds for arbitrary graphs. As part of our analysis of arbitrary graphs $E$ we construct a groupoid $\mathcal{G}_ (C^*(E),\mathcal{D}(E))$ from the graph algebra $C^*(E)$ and its diagonal subalgebra $\mathcal{D}(E)$ which generalises Renault's Weyl groupoid construction applied to $(C^*(E),\mathcal{D}(E))$. We show that $\mathcal{G}_{(C^*(E),\mathcal{D}(E))}$ recovers the graph groupoid $\mathcal{G}_E$ without the assumption that every cycle in $E$ has an exit, which is required to apply Renault's results to $(C^*(E),\mathcal{D}(E))$. We finish with applications of our results to out-splittings of graphs and to amplified graphs.},

abstract = {Sofic groups were defined implicitly by Gromov and explicitly by Weiss. All residually finite groups (and hence all linear groups) are sofic. The purpose of this paper is to introduce, for every countable sofic group $G$, a family of measure-conjugacy invariants for measure-preserving $ G$-actions on probability spaces. These invariants generalize Kolmogorov-Sinai entropy for actions of amenable groups. They are computed exactly for Bernoulli shifts over $G$, leading to a complete classification of Bernoulli systems up to measure-conjugacy for many groups, including all countable linear groups. Recent rigidity results of Y. Kida and S. Popa are utilized to classify Bernoulli shifts over mapping class groups and property (T) groups up to orbit equivalence and von Neumann equivalence, respectively.},

We show how these various groups (as abstract groups) are complete invariants for orbit equivalence, strong orbit equivalence and flip conjugacy, respectively. Furthermore, we introduce an group homomorphism, the so-called mod map, from the normalizers of the various full groups to the automorphism groups of the (ordered) $K^0$-groups, which are associated to the Cantor minimal systems. We show how this in turn is related to the automorphisms of the associated $C^*$-crossed products. Our results are analogues in the topological dynamical setting of results obtained by Dye, Connes-Krieger and Hamachi-Osikawa in measurable dynamics.},

abstract = {We take the first steps towards a better understanding of continuous orbit equivalence, i.e., topological orbit equivalence with continuous cocycles. First, we characterize continuous orbit equivalence in terms of isomorphisms of $C^{\ast }$ -crossed products preserving Cartan subalgebras. This is the topological analogue of the classical result by Singer and Feldman-Moore in the measurable setting. Second, we turn to continuous orbit equivalence rigidity, i.e., the question whether for certain classes of topological dynamical systems, continuous orbit equivalence implies conjugacy. We show that this is not always the case by constructing topological dynamical systems (actions of free abelian groups and also non-abelian free groups) that are continuously orbit equivalent but not conjugate. Furthermore, we prove positive rigidity results. For instance, for solvable duality groups, general topological Bernoulli actions and certain subshifts of full shifts over finite alphabets are rigid.},

One of our objectives is to complete an article of Jolissaint devoted to the study of this property for probability measure preserving countable equivalence relations. Our second goal, concerning the general situation, is to provide a definition of this property in purely geometric terms, whereas this notion had been introduced by Ueda in terms of the associated inclusion of von Neumann algebras. Our equivalent definition makes obvious the fact that treeability implies the Haagerup property for such groupoids and that it is not compatible with Kazhdan's property (T).},

abstract = {We introduce a method to study $C^*$-algebras possessing an action of the circle group, from the point of view of their internal structure and their $K$-theory. Under relatively mild conditions our structure theorem shows that any $C^*$-algebra, where an action of the circle is given, arises as the result of a construction that generalizes crossed products by the group of integers. Such a generalized crossed product construction is carried out for any partial automorphism of a $C^*$-algebra, where by a partial automorphism we mean an isomorphism between two ideals of the given algebra. Our second main result is an extension to crossed products by partial automorphisms, of the celebrated Pimsner-Voiculescu exact sequence for $K$-groups. The representation theory of the algebra arising from our construction is shown to parallel the representation theory for $C^*$-dynamical systems. In particular, we generalize several of the main results relating to regular and covariant representations of crossed products.},

We show that such maps are surjunctive if they commute with sufficiently large automorphism groups. Of particular interest is the case of proalgebraic varieties over infinite graphs. The paper intends to bring out relations between model theory, algebraic geometry, and symbolic dynamics.},

abstract = {Sofic and hyperlinear groups are the countable discrete groups that can be approximated in a suitable sense by finite symmetric groups and groups of unitary matrices. These notions turned out to be very deep and fruitful, and stimulated in the last 15 years an impressive amount of research touching several seemingly distant areas of mathematics including geometric group theory, operator algebras, dynamical systems, graph theory, and more recently even quantum information theory. Several longstanding conjectures that are still open for arbitrary groups were settled in the case of sofic or hyperlinear groups. These achievements aroused the interest of an increasing number of researchers into some fundamental questions about the nature of these approximation properties. Many of such problems are to this day still open such as, outstandingly: Is there any countable discrete group that is not sofic or hyperlinear? A similar pattern can be found in the study of II$_1$ factors. In this case the famous conjecture due to Connes (commonly known as the Connes embedding conjecture) that any II$_1$ factor can be approximated in a suitable sense by matrix algebras inspired several breakthroughs in the understanding of II$_1$ factors, and stands out today as one of the major open problems in the field. The aim of these notes is to present in a uniform and accessible way some cornerstone results in the study of sofic and hyperlinear groups and the Connes embedding conjecture. The presentation is nonetheless self contained and accessible to any student or researcher with a graduate level mathematical background. An appendix by V. Pestov provides a pedagogically new introduction to the concepts of ultrafilters, ultralimits, and ultraproducts for those mathematicians who are not familiar with them, and aiming to make these concepts appear very natural.},

Such pairs are characterized by a group $Q$ which serves as a quotient for the pair, or by the ability to synthesize the larger relation from the smaller and an action (modulo inner automrorphisms) of $Q$ on it; in the case where $A$ is amenable, one can work with a genuine action. We classify ergodic subrelations of finite index, and arbitrary normal subrelations, of the unique amenable relation of type II$_1$. We also give a number of rigidity results; for example, if an equivalence relation is generated by a free II$_1$-action of a lattice in a higher rank simple connected non-compact Lie group with finite centre, the only normal ergodic subrelations are of finite index, and the only strongly normal, amenable subrelations are finite.},

abstract = {Let $(X,\mathscr{B})$ be a standard Borel space, $R\subset X\times X$ an equivalence relation $\in\mathscr{B}\times\mathscr{B}$. Assume each equivalence class is countable. Theorem 1: $\exists$ a countable group $G$ of Borel isomorphisms of $(X,\mathscr{B})$ so that $R=\left\{(x,gx):g\in G\right\}$. $G$ is far from unique. however, notions like invariance and quasi-invariance and $R-N$ derivatives of measures depend only on $R$, not the choice of $G$. We develop some of the ideas of Dye and Krieger in a fashion explicitly avoiding any choice of $G$; we also show the connection with virtual groups. A notion of ``module over $R$'' is defined, and we axiomatize and develop a cohomology theory for $R$ with coefficients in such a module. Surprising application: let $\alpha$, $\beta$ be rationally independent irrationals on the circle $\mathbb{T}$, and $f Borel:$\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{R}$. Then $\exists$ Borel $g$, $h:\mathbb{T}\to\mathbb{T}$ with $f(x)=(g(\alpha x)/g(x))(h(\beta x)/h(x))$ a.e. The notion of ``skew product action'' is generalized to our context, and provides a setting for a generalization of the krieger invariant for the $R-N$ derivative of an ergodic transformation: we define, for a cocycle $c$ on $R$ with values in the group $A$, a subgroup of $A$ depending only on the cohomology class of $c$, and identify this with another subgroup, the ``normalized proper range'' of $c$, defined in terms of the skew action.},

In this paper, we show that $\mathfrak{A}[R]$ is a partial group algebra of the group $K\rtimeK^{\times}$ with suitable relations, where $K$ is the field of fractions of $R$. We identify the spectrum of these relations and we show that it is homeomorphic to the profinite completion of R. By using partial crossed product theory, we reconstruct some results proved by Cuntz and Li. Among them, we prove that $\mathfrak{A}[R]$ is simple by showing that the action is topologically free and minimal.},

We prove that two compact Hausdorff spaces are homeomorphic if and only if there exists a compatibility isomorphism between their families of scalar-valued, continuous functions. We derive the classical theorems of Gelfand--Kolmogorov, Milgram and Kaplansky as easy corollaries to our result as well as a theorem of Jarosz (Bull. Canad. Math.

From this we derive a criterion for simplicity of $R_0\rtimes_\alpha G$ in terms of maximal commutativity and $G$-simplicity of $R_0$. We also provide two applications of our main results. First, we give a new proof of the cimplicity criterion for Leavitt path algebras, as well as a new proof of the Cuntz-Krieger uniqueness theorem. Secondly, we study topological dynamics arising from partial actions on clopen subsets of a compact set.},

abstract = {Given an arbitrary infinite matrix $A=\left\{A(i,j)\right\}_{i,j\in\mathscr{G}}$ with entries in $\left\{0,1\right\}$ and having no identically zero rows, we define an algebra $\mathscr{O}_A$ as the universal $C^*$-algebra generated by partial isometries subject to conditions that ggeneralize, to the infinite case, those introduced by Cuntz and Krieger for finite matrices. We realize $\mathscr{O}_A$ as the crossed product algebra for a partial dynamical system and, based on this description, we extend to the infinite case some of the main results known to hold in the finite case, namely the uniqueness theorem, the classification of ideals, and the simplicity criteria. $\mathscr{O}_A$ is always nuclear and we obtain conditions for it to be unital and purely infinite.},

We address this problem for wreath products, and in particular investigate the behaviour of more general metric approximations of groups under wreath products. Our main result is the following. Suppose that $H$ is a sofic group and $G$ is a countable, discrete group. If $G$ is sofic, hyperlinear, weakly sofic, or linear sofic, then $G\wr H$ is also sofic, hyperlinear, weakly sofic, or linear sofic respectively. In each case we construct relevant metric approximations, extending a general construction of metric approximations for $G\wr H$ that uses soficity of $H$.},

abstract = {Given a group $G$, we construct, in a canonical way, an inverse semigroup $\mathcal{S}(G)$ associated to $G$. The actions of $\mathcal{S}(G)$ are shown to be in one-to-one correspondence with the partial actions of $G$, both in the case of actions on a set, and that of actions as operators on a Hilbert space. In other words, $G$ and $\mathcal{S}(G)$ have the same representation theory. We show that $\mathcal S(G)$ governs the subsemigroup of all closed linear subspaces of a $G$-graded $C^*$-algebra, generated by the grading subspaces. In the special case of finite groups, the maximum number of such subspaces is computed. A ``partial'' version of the group $C^*$-algebra of a discrete group is introduced. While the usual group $C^*$-algebra of finite commutative groups forgets everything but the order of the group, we show that the partial group $C^*$-algebra of the two commutative groups of order four, namely $Z/4 Z$ and $ Z/2 Z \oplus Z/2 Z$, are not isomorphic.},

@article{MR3286052,
abstract = {This is the first part in a series in which sofic entropy theory is generalized to class-bijective extensions of sofic groupoids. Here we define topological and measure entropy and prove invariance. We also establish the variational principle, compute the entropy of Bernoulli shift actions and answer a question of Benjy Weiss pertaining to the isomorphism problem for non-free Bernoulli shifts. The proofs are independent of previous literature.},
