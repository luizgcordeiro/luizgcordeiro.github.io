    "  3-6 Variations on O and Omega\n",
    "  Some authors define Omega-notation in a slightly different way than this textbook does. We'll use the nomenclature Omega-inf (read \"omega infinity\") for this alternative definition. We say that f(n)=Omega-inf(g(n)) if there exists a positive constant c such that f(n) >= c g(n) >= 0 for infinitely many integers n.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  a. Show that for any two asymptotically nonnegative functions f(n) and g(n), we have f(n)=O(g(n)) or f(n)=Omega-inf(g(n)) (or both).\n",
    "  b. Show that there exist two asymptotically nonnegative functions f(n) and g(n) for which neither f(n)=O(g(n)) nor f(n)=Omega(g(n)) holds.\n",
    "  c. Describe the potential advantages and disadvantages of using Omega-inf-notation instead of Omega-notation to characterize the running times of programs.\n",
    "  \n",
    "  Some authors also define O in a slightly different manner. We'll use O' for the alternative definition: f(n)=O'(g(n)) if and only if |f(n)|=O(g(n)).\n",
    "  \n",
    "  d. What happens to each direction of the \"if and only if\" in Theorem 3.1 on page 56 if we substitute O' for O but still use Omega?\n",
    "\n",
    "  Some authors define O-til (read \"soft-oh\") to mean O with logarithmic factors ignored:\n",
    "    O-til(g(n))={f(n) : there exist positive constants c, k, and n0 such that 0 <= f(n) <= c g(n) lg^k(n) for all n>=n0}.\n",

    "  e. Define Omega-til and Theta-til in a similar manner. Prove the corresponding analog to Theorem 3.1.\n",
    "\n",
    "  SOLUTION:\n",
    "  a. Omega-inf(g(n)) is the complement of o(g(n)). Thus every function is Omega-inf(g(n)) or o(g(n)), and in particular O(g(n)) in the latter case.\n",
    "  b. f(n)=1 if n is even and n if n is odd, and g(n)=f(n+1)\n",
    "  c. Advantages: As noticed before, Omega-inf is simply the complement of small-o, so this notion comes with all advantages and disadvantages as small-o comes with when compared with big-O.\n",
    "    More particularly, if we really wish to use just Omega-inf as-is, to state that f(n)=Omega-inf(g(n)) means to say that \"a part of f(n) grows at least as fast as a part of g(n)\", or that \"we cannot ever garantee that f(n) will be asymptotically smaller than g(n)\", which cannot be so well-stated directly in terms of Omega. On the other hand, Omega allows us to make a statement of which function is certainly faster or slower asymptotically, which cannot be easily stated in terms of Omega-inf.\n",
    "  d. The theorems remains valid, since the statement that f(n)=Omega(g(n)) already implies that f(n) is asymptotically positive, so stating that f(n)=O(g(n)) is the same as stating that f(n)=O'(g(n)).\n",
