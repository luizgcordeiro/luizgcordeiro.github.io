    ">Although merge sort runs in $\\Theta(n \\lg n))$ worst-case time and insertion sort runs in $\\Theta(n^2)$ worst-case time, the constant factors in insertion sort can make it faster in practice for small problem sizes on many machines. Thus, it makes sense to ***coarsen*** the leaves of the recursion by using insertion sort within merge sort when subproblems become sufficiently small. Consider a modification to merge sort in which $n/k$ sublists of length $k$ are sorted using insertion sort and then merged using the standard mergin mechanism, where $k$ is a value to be determined.\n",

So to count how many inversions of the form $(i,j)$ there are for a given $j$, we need only to check how many of the elements in $A[1:(j-1)]$ are greater than $A[j]$. Each of these elements corresponds to an iteration of the while loop in lines 5-7 of `INSERTION-SORT`.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Thus, the number of inversions of an array is exactly the number of iterations of the while loop in lines 5-7 of `INSERTION-SORT`.\n",
    "    \n",
    "4. The part of `MERGE-SORT` that compares and swaps elements is the merge procedure, which only looks at a subarray of the form $A[p:q]$. So let us see how we can keep track of inversions in this manner.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Suppose that we have subarrays $A[p:q]$ and $A[q+1:r]$  and that we do know how many inversions there are inner to $A[p:q]$ and to $A[q+1:r]$ originally; call these numbers $x$ and $y$, respectively.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    If we want to count how many inversions there are in the (original) array $A[p:r]$, we just need to check how many inversions there are which involve an elemento f $A[p,q]$ and an element of $A[q+1:p]$ - i.e., an inversion of the form $(i,j)$ with $p\\leq i\\leq q<j\\leq r$. These inversions corresponds to the \"else\" statement in line 16 of the `MERGE` procedure being run. However, if we find such $i$ and $j$ then in fact we have found several inversions, since $A[p:q]$ is ordered: $(i,j)$, $(i+1,j)$, $\\ldots$, $(q,j)$. In any case, in this manner, we can obtain how many inversions there are originally in the subarray $A[p:r]$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, the strength of `MERGE-SORT` (which makes it cost $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ instead of $\\Theta(n^2)$) is that it sorts an array $A[p:r]$ _which is broken into two **ordered** subarrays_, as this can be done in linear time. So to count the number of permutation with the same running time as `MERGE-SORT`, we will still need to order the initial array.\n",
