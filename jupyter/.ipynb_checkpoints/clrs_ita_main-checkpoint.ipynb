    "    If we want to count how many inversions there are in the (original) array $A[p:r]$, we just need to check how many inversions there are which involve an elemento f $A[p,q]$ and an element of $A[q+1:p]$ - i.e., an inversion of the form $(i,j)$ with $p\\leq i\\leq q<j\\leq r$. These inversions corresponds to the \"else\" statement in line 16 of the `MERGE` procedure being run. However, if we find such $i$ and $j$ then in fact we have found several inversions, since $A[p:q]$ is ordered: $(i,j)$, $(i+1,j)$, $\\ldots$, $(q,j)$. In any case, in this manner, we can obtain how many inversions there are originally in the subarray $A[p:r]$.\n",
    "    \n",
    "    However, the strength of `MERGE-SORT` (which makes it cost $\\Theta(n\\lg n)$ instead of $\\Theta(n^2)$) is that it sorts an array $A[p:r]$ _which is broken into two **ordered** subarrays_, as this can be done in linear time. So to count the number of permutation with the same running time as `MERGE-SORT`, we will still need to order the initial array.\n",

    "We denote by $\\mathbb{Z}=\\left\\{\\ldots,-2,-1,0,1,2,\\ldots\\right\\}$ the set of natural numbers, and $\\mathbb{R}$ the set of real numbers. Subscripts with unary predicates (possibly curried from many-ary predicates) are used to denote the restricted sets. So, for example, $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq 0} = \\left\\{n\\in\\mathbb{Z}\\mid n\\geq 0\\right\\}$ is a way to denote the set of ***natural numbers***. From now on, we only consider functions which are defined at least on a set of the form $\\mathbb{Z}_{\\geq a}$ for some $a\\in\\mathbb{Z}$ and which are asymptotically nonnegative (as defined in the book). As all definitions deal with limits at infinity, we do not need to worry too much about domains of functions being the same in our setting .\n",
    "\n",
    "First, recall that a function does not depend on any variable. So a proper mathematical definition of $O$-notation would be as follows:\n",

    "Of course, when there is no confusion, we may always specify a variable to be used for all formulas, and identify a function with a formula in the usual manner, and we will not refrain from doing this. However, this ought to be avoided when more than one variable is being used, as inconsistencies could arise. For example, as done in the book (p. 58), we allows ourselves to use $O(f)$ in place of a function $g\\in O(f)$. This well and good for simple expressions. In particular, if we were to interpret the expression \"$\\sum_{i=1}^n O(i)$\", this ought to be interpreted as a function of the form\n",

    "where $f_i\\in O(i)$ for each $i$. That is, $f_1\\in O(1)$, $f_2\\in O(2)$, $\\ldots$. However, the exact opposite is said in the book (p. 58), where it is stated that \"*in the expression $\\sum_{i=1}^n O(i)$ there is a single anonymous function (a function of $i$)*\".\n",
    "\n",
    "This problem arises from another convention: \"*The number of anonymous functions in an expression is understood to be equal to the number of times the asymptotic notation appears.*\". So, in fact, sometimes \"$O(f(n))$\" should be read as the **value** $g(n)$ for some $g\\in O(f)$ and some parameter $n$, and not as the function $g$. This ought to be more precisely written as $[O(f)](n)$.\n",

    "With this interpretation, $\\sum_{i=1}^n O(f(i))$ actually stands for $\\sum_{i=1}^n g(i)$ (which is a value depending on $n$) for some function $g\\in O(f)$. This applies in particular for $\\sum_{i=1}^n O(i)$, as long as we want this to denote the value (depending on $n$) of some function $g$, by taking $f$ the identity function in the previous phrase.\n",

    "#### Running time of an algorithm\n",
    "\n",
    "Recall that ***running time*** is a notion that depends on an specific input, and not solely on the algorithm being executed (as is explicitly stated in p. 30). For an algorithm (or procedure) $A$ and a valid input $x$, we denote by $\\operatorname{time}(A,x)$ the time that algorithm $A$ takes to evaluate $A(x)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "However, we are interested in analysing running time with respect to some notion of \"size\" of an input, which itself depends on context: If an input is an array (as in sorting algorithms), the \"size\" is (usually) the length of the array; if the input is an integer (as in an algorithm which checks whether a number is prime or not), its \"size\" could be its absolute value.\n",
    "\n",
    "So, to properly define \"*running time*\", we need a notion of \"size\", which should be clear (even if implicit) from context. The following definitions are the ones used throughout the book:\n",
    "\n",
    "> The **worst-case running time** of an algorithm $A$ is the function\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$n\\longmapsto \\sup\\left\\{\\operatorname{time}(A,x):x\\text{ has size }n\\right\\}$$\n",

    "> and the **best-case running time** of $A$ is the function\n",
    ">\n",
    "> $$n\\longmapsto \\inf\\left\\{\\operatorname{time}(A,x):x\\text{ has size }n\\right\\}.$$\n",
    ">\n",
    "> We say that algorithm $A$ has **running time $O(f)$** if its *worst*-case running time is so. Similarly, algorithm $A$ has **running time $\\Omega(f)$** if its *best*-case running time is so, and **running time $\\Theta(f)$** if it has both running time $O(f)$ and $\\Omega(f)$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Let us finish this discussion with a simple theorem. It has obvious analogues for $\\Omega$ and $\\Theta$ asymptotics, which we ommit.\n",
    "\n",
    "> **Theorem**: Algorithm $A$ has running time $\\Omega(f)$ if and only if for any sequence of inputs $(x_n)_{n=1}^\\infty$ with each $x_n$ of size $n$, we have $\\operatorname{time}(A,x_n)=\\Omega(f(n))$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Indeed, the \"only if\" part is immediate from the definition of supremum, so we take care of the \"if\" part. Assume that the latter property is true. Let $w\\colon n\\mapsto w(n)$ denote the worst-case running time function (with paremeter an input size $n$).\n",
    "\n",
    "First, note that we can assume that $f(n)>0$ for all sufficiently large $n$. If this is not the case, then there are infinitely many integers $n$ such that $f(n)=0$. Then for all sufficiently large such $n$ and all choices $x_n$ of inputs of sizes $n$ we have $\\operatorname{time}(A,x_n)=0$, by the definition of $O(f)$, from which it follows that $w(n)=0$ for all such $n$ as well. Thus, we can simply ignore such $n$ for which $f(n)=0$.\n",
    "\n",
    "Similarly, we can also assume that $w(n)<\\infty$ for all $n$, since this implies $f(n)=\\infty$ as well for sufficiently large $n$.\n",
    "\n",
    "For any $n\\in\\mathbb{N}$, choose an input $x_n$ of size $n$ such that $\\operatorname{time}(x_n)>w(n)-\\dfrac{f(n)}{n}$. Then\n",

    "If we want a more interesting answer, we can recall that, in common usage, saying that \"*$x$ is at least $y$*\" means that $x$ is greater than $y$ in some sense depending on context.
